If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

In spite of that, they sound good.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Thank you Thank you!!!!\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Earbuds Sounds good\\n- ID: B0BLJXPRL9, review: S23Bluetooth earbuds Both that I have purchased have been gifts.

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

In spite of that, they sound good.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Thank you Thank you!!!!\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Earbuds Sounds good\\n- ID: B0BLJXPRL9, review: S23Bluetooth earbuds Both that I have purchased have been gifts.

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!

I ordered it because I want something small to carry my Microsoft Surface, kindle, and maybe a notebook and some pens to class.  This bag provides me exactly that ability, no more, no less.  If you want a small bag that can fit a minimalist amount of items, this is a great option!  I cannot say enough good things about this bag if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stay organized and minimalist.  I have divided my review into 3 parts: Durability, Usefulness, and Aesthetics.<br /><br />Durability (5/5):  The material of this bag is of good quality.  The zippers are not cheaply made, the handles are firm and well attached.  The clasps and shoulder strap are even made of good material (typically the shoulder strap is where companies save money in their design).  The padding on the inside of the bag is also good quality.  Due to it being more of a minimalist bag, the padding is not ultra-thick and protective.  I would not buy this bag as a defense against computer drops (although I am pretty confident it would be enough padding to protect your computer if it were to fall).  I am very impressed with this bag's durability.<br /><br />Usefulness (5/5):  This rating will vary based off what you are looking for out of the bag.  If you want a computer bag that can fit all of your school books, a bunch of different cables and accessories then you'll definitely want something bigger.  Personally, that isn't what I was looking for.  As I said earlier, I just wanted an organized way I could transport a few items without having to lug around a backpack or a huge bag.  This bag is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Aesthetic (5/5):  If you like how this bag looks in the product description you will like this bag.  The only thing I do need to point out in this aspect is the bag doesn't maintain its shape too well when bulky items are in it.  Aka, it does not really have any stiff material on it to force it to remain with sharp edges and keep it from wrinkling.  That said, if you are only putting a laptop, some pens, maybe a charging cord in it then it will still maintain its look.  I also enjoy its flexibility when wearing it across my shoulder, as it actually wraps a bit around where it is resting against your side which keeps it from bouncing up and down as you walk.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great bag!  I will be using it as my primary bag for a long time.  If you are a little worried about if it will be a quality bag for such a cheap price, have no fear!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.\\n- ID: B0C2C87FW3, review: Just what I wanted Just what I wanted\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: A good product Handles my Lenovo 15in laptop quite well\\n- ID: B0B62LR2YT, review: Great product for the money!
